# Applying Gaussian Differential Privacy to Heart Disease Data

# Project Overview

During this academic research project related to healthcare data security and privacy, I played a pivotal role in safeguarding sensitive information. In collaboration with a dedicated team, our mission was to protect individual patient privacy while enabling healthcare statisticians to analyze data for informed decision-making.

In this group project, we applied the Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) algorithm to a heart disease dataset, effectively adding a controlled amount of noise to maintain privacy. The degree of noise was determined by the sensitivity of the queries and the desired level of privacy protection. Importantly, this approach ensured that statistical information in the data remained intact.



# My Contributions

As a key member of the project team, my responsibilities encompassed:

1. Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset was accurate and devoid of inconsistencies.
2. Data Processing: Preparing the data for analysis, making it ready for privacy protection measures.
3. Model Selection and Training: Identifying the 7 suitable machine learning models and training them for accurate predictions.
4. Model Evaluation: Rigorously assessing the models' performance to ensure data integrity and privacy protection.
5. Application of Gaussian Differential Privacy: Implementing the GDP algorithm to maintain individual patient privacy while retaining statistical significance.



# Collaboration

This collaborative project also included two other team members who focused on researching the GDP mechanism. They provided comprehensive explanations and coding solutions related to sensitivity principles, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of our privacy protection approach. I haven't included their code here. If you would like to access all the related code implementations, please reach out via the email address.
